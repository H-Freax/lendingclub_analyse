# 📊 Data Analysis on Lending Club Dataset

Welcome to the data-driven journey through the Lending Club universe! 🚀 Here, we slice and dice the numbers to predict loan defaults, harnessing the power of machine learning and neural network wizardry. 

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `data/`: The treasure chest where the dataset gems are stored. You might find this chest empty due to GitHub's size limits, but fear not! The map to the data treasure is provided below. 🗺️
- `lgb_Lending_Club.ipynb`: The spellbook 📜 where the magic happens - dive into this Jupyter notebook for an enchanting code experience with LightGBM and more!
- `README.md`: You are here! 📍 This scroll details everything you need to embark on your data quest.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Embark on a two-part adventure:

- **Part 1:** We craft a baseline model using the mystic arts of LightGBM, conjuring derived variables to enhance our model’s foresight. 🔮
